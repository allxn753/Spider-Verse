# Spider-Verse
ICS4U Culminating (Java). This program combines multiple images into one depending on what the user chooses.

In this program, the user gets to choose from 5 different Spider-Man suit options to mix and match:
- Peter's Suit
- Spider-Verse Suit (Miles)
- 2099 Suit (Miles)
- TRACK Suit
- Programmable Matter Suit

The user gets to choose their head, body, and legs. Once they choose one of the 5 suits for each portion, the program loads the images of each of their choices and compiles them into one png file (The user gets to name the Spider-Man, which will also be the name of its png file). The png image of the user's Spider-Man will be saved to their PC and the name of their Spider-Man will be saved in the "saved.txt" file.

The user also has the option to load one of their saved Spider-Men. By giving the program the name of the Spider-Man they want to load, the program will open the png image from the user's PC.
